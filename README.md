# Welcome to My Profile!

Hello,

I'm Renan, a Software Developer with a focus on web development and back-end. I'm currently improving my proficiency in ReactJS and Node.js, while also working with MongoDB, noSQL, GraphQL, and more.

Beyond languages and tools, my real fascination lies in the development process itself. I'm always studying architecture, design patterns, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and more to deepen my expertise.

I'm based in Portugal and hold both European (Italian) and Brazilian citizenship.
